Hi, this repo isn't finished yet. I encourage you to see my other repos, especially "python".

## Do you enjoy fresh juice? 
###I definitely do. But I always had a problem how many fruit and vegetables I should cut to fit into that 300ml glass.
###With JuicyManufactory this problem is solved!
### Here is your very own application where you can compose your fresh juice and know exactly how much of it will come out of a slow juicer.

What I used?
* Back-end: Flask
* Database: postgres
* Front-end: Jinja2 templating engine and Bootstrap templates.

To run this application:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 app.py
```
